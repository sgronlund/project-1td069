## Dataset used in Analytics

For the large-scale data analytics we're using a dataset from [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/), specifically the dataset called [`global-hourly`](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database) which contains hourly observations from different land and weather stations around the world.
